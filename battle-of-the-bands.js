// Your job is to write a function that accepts any band name as an argument. The function will increment a global variable by one each time it is invoked, and return that number, and the band name concatenated together.



// const scum = takeNumber("Galactic Scum")
// console.log(scum)  // This should print "1. Galactic Scum" in the console

// const under = takeNumber("Underdogs")
// console.log(under)  // This should print "2. Underdogs" in the console
